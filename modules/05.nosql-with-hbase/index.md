# NoSQL with HBase

## NoSQL definition

- **Key-value**:
  - 1 key = 1 value
  - Examples : Redis, Memcache (in memory)
- **Wide-column**:
  - each column or column family is stored separately
  - Examples : Apache HBase, Apache Cassandra (ScyllaDB)
- **Document stores**:
  - JSON/XML like objects
  - Examples : MongoDB, CouchDB
- **Graph**:
  - Store nodes and relationships (edges) between them
  - Examples : Neo4j, JanusGraph

## Apache HBase

- _Apache HBaseâ„¢ is the Hadoop database, a distributed, scalable, big data store_ ([hbase.apache.org](hbase.apache.org))
- Random, realtime read/write access to Big Data.
- Inspired from Google BigTable paper (2006).
- Relies on HDFS for storage.

## HBase: introduction

- The CAP theorem (covered in Big Data introduction).
- HBase is a **CP columnar** database.
- Conversely, [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org) focuses on AP.

## HBase: data structure

- A table is a collection of rows.
- A row has several **column families** defined at table creation.
- A column family has **any number of columns**.
- Logicial representation of 1 row.
  ```json
  {
    "key_1": {
      "column_family_1": { "col_1": "a", "col_2": "b"},
      "column_family_2": { "col_3": "c", "col_4": "d"}
    }
  }
  ```
  OR its flatten representation.
  ```text
  key_1 > column_family_1 > col_1 : "a"
  key_1 > column_family_1 > col_2 : "b"
  key_1 > column_family_2 > col_1 : "c"
  key_1 > column_family_2 > col_2 : "d"
  ```
- Physical representation of 1 row.
  ```text
  |---------------------|    |---------------------|
  |   column_family_1   |    |   column_family_2   | 
  |=====================|    |=====================|
  | key_1 > col_1 : "a" |    | key_1 > col_1 : "c" |
  | key_1 > col_2 : "b" |    | key_1 > col_2 : "d" |
  |---------------------|    |---------------------|
  ```

## HBase: data storage

- Data is stored:
  - In HDFS in the **HFiles**.
  - In RAM in the **Memstore**.
- Tables are split into **regions**:
  - 1 region = all rows in a certain **range of keys**.
  - The number of regions depends on the size of the table.

![HBase architecture](./assets/hbase_architecture.png)

## HBase: architecture

- **HBase Master**
  - Handle table creation/deletion queries.
  - **Assigns regions** to RegionServers and monitor them.
- **RegionServer**
  - 1 region of a table is managed by 1 RegionServer.

## HBase: data storage in RegionServers

1. On data write:
   - Storing in the **Memstore in RAM**.
   - Storing in the **HLog in HDFS** (Write Ahead Log).
2. When the Memstore or the HLog reaches max size: flush to **HFile in HDFS** (1 per CF). Temporary **compactions**.
3. If the RegionServer crashes, operations are replayed from the HLog for the Memstore and metadata loaded from the HFile (by another RegionServer).

## HBase: partition tolerance and HA

- RegionServers tracked by ZooKeeper:
  - On crash, HMaster knows it through ZooKeeper.
  - HMaster re-assigns regions to other RegionServers.
- High Availability: multiple HBase Masters.

## HBase: querying

- HBase client
  - CLI
  - Languages / tools (e.g. NiFi)
- Apache Phoenix, SQL on HBase (in memory)
- Apache Hive
